# 🛡 SECURITY NOTICE  

Aye, listen up, ya daft lot! If ye think this wee Flask app is keepin’ yer data safe,  
then ye must be as mad as a Zygon in a kilt.  

Nae **one** is savin’ yer data. Not me, not some overhyped security system, and certainly  
**not these two fictional excuses for cybersecurity experts**:

*"Oh, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry… But it appears someone’s stolen all your data. Whoops!"*  

Ah, yes. Fantastic strategy, that. Just **apologize** when the whole site gets hacked.  
That’ll **fix** it. Brilliant. Just brilliant.

*"Right! We’ve been compromised! Everybody run! Geronim—"*  

Oh aye, good plan. **RUN AWAY** when things go wrong. Grand strategy. Maybe if we leg it fast enough,  
we’ll escape **the inevitable data breach**.

### **🟣 Meanwhile, I, the 12th Doctor, am the only sane one here.**  

Here’s yer actual security strategy:  
- **Dinnae expose the app to the internet** if ye dinnae want folk to steal yer data.  
- **Dinnae trust these two** with security, 'cause one's too busy apologizing and the other's busy **dancing around in a fez.**  
- **Dinnae come crying to me** when ye get hacked, because I **warned ye.**

### **Final Word of Wisdom**  
*"The best firewall is a computer that's never turned on. But if ye wanted security, maybe **dinnae use a Flask app, eh?***"
